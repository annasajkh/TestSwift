# Test Swift
Trying swift lol

# Personally what i didn't like about the language right now
- no namespaces
- cross platform support still not good (lsp doesn't work sometimes and lacks of libraries)
- i don't like forced named parameters, if a function have named params when you call it you have to use named params, though i can see the value
- lacks of oop features
